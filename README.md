# LeicaGAN

Pytorch re-implementation for Paper [Learn, Imagine and Create: Text-to-Image Generation from Prior Knowledge] by Tingting Qiao, Jing Zhang, Duanqing Xu, Dacheng Tao. (The work was performed when Tingting Qiao was a visiting student at UBTECH Sydney AI Centre in the School of Computer Science, FEIT, the University of Sydney).

The official (original) repository of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/qiaott/LeicaGAN). 

This repository contains an effort of some student(See list below) of the African Master in Machine INtelligence (https://aimsammi.org/) to reproduice the paper. 

## Project Overview

The LeicaGAN framework is a follow :
